# Simulator Template
Basic template to start a simulator game. I have no documentation on it yet, but I'm planning to start documenting everything and posting it here, as well as updating the template to polish or add small features. Anyways, the template shouldn't scale too much from here, as it's supossed to be a base to work with, not a finished project.
